1. What is Unit Testing and why we need to do this?
Answer: Unit testing is testing individual unit (smallest testable part of your code) of code. eg. function, service, component
        We need to the unit testing because-
        1. Trust changes make on existing code.
        2. If we don't have unit testing in our code, we need to test it manually while making any changes
        3. To maintain the code quality and bug free
        4. Changes occurs quickly.
        5. Unit testing provides you the best documentation (Act as a documentation)

2. Testing Frameworks - Jasmine (Angular), Jest (ReactJS), mocha and many more....

3. Jasmine - Behaviour Driven Testing Framework

4. Testing file naming convention-
        testing file extension name-
          1. *.spec.js
          2. *.test.js
        Naming convention-
          1. (Target file name).spec.js
          2. (Target file name).test.js

5. Suites - A suites is a group of spec or tests. If you have lot of tests you will group them and that group is called suites.
          - It will organize the tests.

6. Spec file (*.spec.js) having -> Test Suites (Group of spec) having -> Spec or test cases (Group of expectations)

7. What is Expectations -> you can think of it as Assertions -> Assertions is just a statement -> Result of a statement either true or false

8. Passing or Failure Spec? When we can say that spec is passing or failure??
Ans: Passing Spec -> Spec with all the true expectations is a passing spec.
     Failure Spec -> Spec having one or more false expectations is a failure spec.
